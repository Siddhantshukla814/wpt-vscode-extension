# Visual Studio Code Extension For WebPageTest
The Visual Studio Code(Vscode) Extension for WebPageTest lets you run tests against WebPageTest from within Vscode. Once the tests are complete, some of the performance metrics, a copy of the waterfall, screenshot, and a link to the full results will be displayed in Vscode, right where you are developing, helping you to easily troubleshoot and diagnose performance issues directly from Vscode and possibly refactor the code if needed.
